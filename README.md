# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation
This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python, including:

-   Backpropagation
-   Neural Network
-   Gradient Descent
-   GCNN (Graph Convolutional Neural Network)
-   ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)
-   Naive Bayes
-   Linear Regression
-   SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization)

## Getting Started

To use the algorithms in this repository, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You'll also need to install Numpy and Pandas 
``` bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
``` 

This will install the necessary packages for all algorithms.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented as a Python module, and comes with an example usage script in the `examples/` directory. To run an example, navigate to the relevant directory and run the script.
For example, to run the neural network example, do:

```bash
cd Basic\ Neural\ Network
python NN.py
```
